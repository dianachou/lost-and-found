# Lost and Found

Name:
Lost & Found

Description:

Suppose you lost your wallet or umbrella in a public place; would you know where to start looking to find it? Perhaps a good-samaritan might find your item, may pick it up to keep it safe, but how would they know how to contact you to return your property? Even on a college campus, not many people know where the local lost-and-found collections are managed, so found items are often trashed or kept, and lost items rarely recovered. Our app aims to bridge this divide and return the found to the lost.

Whether one is working, running and errand, or even just lounging at home, people still have the tendency to be forgetful and misplace their belongings. This is especially common when one is in a hurry or subjected to hectic conditions. 

This app would implement a "lost-and-found" system that allows users to both (1) search for a lost item within a vicinity (could be on a campus, in a mall, at a park, or just a general area) or (2) indicate that they have found a misplaced item that belongs to another â€“ by making a posting with details such as the location found, pictures, item description, and tags (for searching ability).

Functionalities:
- A rating/credibility system that shows users are actual people who legitimately trying to help people in the community
- Timeframe and additional details in a posting
- User contact information (have some be required and others be confidential)
- Notifications every time an object similar to what one is finding, gets posted
